# Experience

## Azendoo
**Software Engineer (2011 - current)**

[Azendoo](http://www.azendoo.com) is an online social productivity solution. You can manage projects with tasks, messages, direct messages and documents on the web, desktop, iOS or Android. I started at Azendoo as a frontend developer in 2011, and became lead developer in 2014.

**Code** My first mission was to transition from a Ruby on Rails/MongoDB application to a client version of the web app based on Backbone.js consuming a JSON API built with Rails. After building the MVP, we launched the first version out of beta in 2012. In 2015, I was part of the build of the direct messages feature: I changed the frontend to use React.js and Flux, with tests. I've also participated in the development of the following features and elements: timeline, navigation & frame, user administration, payment process, search, notifications and analytics.

**Product & Design** Azendoo's designers used Sketch and hosted files on Dropbox. Design reviews were done with Invision. I helped elaborate roadmaps to anticipate forthcoming features and give feedback on them.

**Team** As the team grew, my Azendoo colleagues and I took active steps to better structure our development process: Git flow branching model, Git commitizen for commit messages, CI to continuously test and deploy our code, code reviews and QA.

**Blog & website** After a first version on Wordpress, I set up a Node.js-based blog with Ghost for Azendoo. The website was built with Ruby on Rails.

Skills: Ruby on Rails, React.js, Javascript, Node.js, HTML/CSS, Git, Tests

## Hobbies

**Music & Drums** 

I started playing the drums when I was 15 years old and I still play regularly now. Whether it has been in a band or with a group of friends, I try to rehearse at least once a week.

With 3 other colleagues, we played at Grand Théatre de Bordeaux on February, 2016. We played on wine barrels for 400 people in a spectacular hall. Taylor & Yandell produced a making-of video: [watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a6l7J3W9H0).

In 2010, I and some of my fellow students organized Muzikorama, a major student festival. Before that, in 2008, we ran a music blog with photographer and journalist friends, called Bichehype.


**Sports**

I have been practising swimming for 10 years. I still swim, but prefer to go to the gym or for a run in the morning to get my day off to a good start. And I won't say no to a game of badminton or squash when asked :)


**Tech**

I fell in love with programming in my early years, at around 13 years old. I hacked the family computer to run it smoothly and be able to run games. Then, I started to build blogs, forums and discovered the Internet: that blew my mind! My life changed and I decided that I wanted to be building stuff on the Internet for as long as possible.
