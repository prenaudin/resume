# Experiences

## Azendoo
**Software Engineer (2011 - current)**

[Azendoo](http://www.azendoo.com) is an online social productivity solution. You can manage projects with tasks, messages, direct messages and documents on the web, desktop, iOS or Android. I started at Azendoo as a frontend developer in 2011 and became lead developer in 2014.

**Code** First mission was to transition from a Ruby on Rails/MongoDB application to a client version of the web app based on Backbone.js consuming a JSON API built with Rails. After building the MVP, we launched the first version out of beta in 2012. In 2015, I took part of the Direct Messages feature: I changed the frontend to use React.js and Flux, with tests. I also participated to the development of: timeline, navigation & frame, users administration, payment process, search, notifications and analytics.

**Product & Design** Designers used Sketch and hosted files on Dropbox. Design reviews were made with Invision. I took part to roadmaps to anticipate features and give feedbacks on them.

**Team** As the team grew, I set up with the others Azendoo fellows some structure to our development process: Git flow branching model, Git commitizen for commit messages, CI to continuously test and deploy our code, code reviews and QA.

**Blog & website** After a first version on Wordpress, I set up a Node.js based blog with Ghost for Azendoo. The website was built with Ruby on Rails.

Skills: Ruby on Rails, React.js, Javascript, Node.js, HTML/CSS, Git, Tests

## Hoobies

**Music & Drums** 

I started to play drums when I was 15 years old and I still play. Always in a band or a group of friends, we do rehearsal at least once per week.

With 3 other fellows, we did a venue at Grand Théatre de Bordeaux on February, 2016. We played on wine barrels for 400 people in a gorgeous hall. Taylor & Yandel produced a video of the making-of, [watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a6l7J3W9H0).

In 2010, we organized Muzikorama, a major student festival, in Bordeaux with the students on the campus. Before, in 2008, we ran a music blog with photographers and journalists friends called Bichehype.


**Sports**

I praticed swimming for 10 years. I still swim but prefer to go to the gym or run before anything in the morning. And I won't say no to badminton or squash when asked for one :)


**Tech**

I found in love with programming in my early years, ~13 years old. I hacked the family computer to run it smoothly and be able to run games. Then, I started to build blogs, forums and found Internet: blowed my mind! My life changed and I decided to be build stuff on the Internet for as long as I can.
